 # hello-world
exploring the enrichment of a collaborative enviroment

Welcome all, to the chaos that is my mind. I'm not sure what I plan on building here,
but the excitement of being allowed to review the work of the "masters of the trade"
motivates me to make a fresh pot of Java, As I see this becoming the beginning of 
many sleepless nights!

My coding experience is limited to VB.Net and Java (at the basic level); and to be honest my
VB isn't as expansive as I'd like it to be. I'm here to learn and share any information that
will help with the growth of my knowledge, and hopefully yours.
